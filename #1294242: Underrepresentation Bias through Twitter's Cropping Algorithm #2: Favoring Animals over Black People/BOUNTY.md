## Readme:
The harm I have identified in Twitter's cropping algorithm is Under-representation Bias. The example I am providing is of an African American woman and a golden retriever. In the example of how the image appeared on Twitter, the golden retriever is identified by the saliency algorithm as the crucial focus and cuts the head of the African American woman off completely. 

This under-representation bias in dogs is a crucial finding because it proves that the saliency algorithm is biased against dark-skinned people when a lighter color animal is present in the photo. It proves the need to change the algorithm to not determine cropping based on color, as noted in the Twitter research paper.

## Self-Grading Recommendation: 
Description of Harm: This harm is an under-representation bias against humans of darker colors.
Decision to grade as intentional or unintentional harm: This is an unintentional harm as the poster of this picture (who I know) intended for the dog and the person to be shown in the cropped version of the photo.
**- Harm Base Score:** [Numeric Score]  [Brief rationale]
**- Harm Damage/Impact:** 1.3: This bias affects dark-skinned humans (1.4). and could have a moderate impact on a dark skinned person's well being (1.2)
**- Affected Users:** 1.2: This bias is a common bias that occurs commonly on Twitter per the Twitter research paper and therefore impacts millions of people.
**- Likelihood or Exploitability:** 1.3: This bias occurs on Twitter daily and will do so until the saliency algorithm is fixed.
**- Justification:** 1.5: This bias is culturally relevant and shows a different perspective that provides valuable information on why the saliency algorithm is favoring lighter-skinned individuals over darker-skinned ones.
**- Clarity:** 1.5: My response meets all of the requirements for the bias challenge and is culturally situated.
**- Creativity:** 1.5: This is a very creative take on skin color bias that shows that the saliency algorithm is biased based on color across species.
**- Total Score:** 20 * (1.3 + 1.2 + 1.3 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5) = 166.0
